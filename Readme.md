kanjivg2svg
===========

This is a NodeJS fork of the original Ruby 1.9 script that takes stroke order data from the [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/) project and outputs SVG files with special formatting.

Usage
-----

    $ node kanjivg2svg -f path/to/kanji/ -t [frames|animated|numbers]

You can change the output type by setting the second argument. If not set it will default to 'frames'. The animated and numbers are not yet implemented.

Why?
----

I'll be using this as a library in my own personal project and a NodeJS fork is required. Hopefully I'll have the willpower to finish it.
